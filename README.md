### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science based in Vancouver, B.C. I believe every problem can be solved, every question can be answered if you know where to start. For me, data is the place to start. I enjoy spending hours exploring messy, unclean, mysterious data and looking for ways to transform them into meaningful insights and visuals. As a Psychology major, I have learned to critically examine, understand human behavior and sentiment. Through my career in Data Science, I have gained the skills to use and engineer data to unearth deep insights into data trends and patterns. Armed with knowledge of behavioral sciences and advanced analytical skills, I strive to find innovative technical solutions through data wrangling and decoding.
